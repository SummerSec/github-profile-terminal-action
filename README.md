# github-profile-terminal-action

This is gross, hacked together code that generates my [profile README.md](https://github.com/liamg), including the stupid gif.

You can try to use it to automatically create your GitHub profile README, nested inside a terminal, nested inside a GIF, built by a GitHub action.
